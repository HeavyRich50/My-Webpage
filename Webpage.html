		<h2> Hello!</h2>
		<p> Welcome to my html website, my name is Richard and I am a Junior IT student at <a href="https://www.georgiasouthern.edu" target="_blank"><em>Georgia Southern University</em>.</a><br> I chose to switch from Computer Science to IT because at the time I was greatly suffering from changes happening in the CS program at the time, I figured a close relative major would keep me nearly in the same fold depending on the specification I pursue.<br> Due to the trouble of getting into seat limited classes and limited funds for summer courses, I hope now to graduate by spring of 2022.</p>
			<ul> <strong> Spring 2021 Classes</strong>
				<li>Programming Principles II</li>
				<li>IT Infrastructure</li>
				<li>Web Page Development</li>
				<li>Operating Systems</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h2 style="color:crimson;"> The Works</h2>
		<p> My plan for for next summer is to find an internship close to my location or that will provide housing so I can have further experience in my field and something to put on my resume.<br> If that doesn't work out I worked with the school electricians for a summer and I'm sure I can return again and continue being on school payroll.<br> Regardless I don't ever plan on going without a job, idling about and going without some kind of income just isn't how I operate.<br>After graduation I hope to have an offer for a job that will help me continue to pay my rent and keep something in my pocket so I'm not scrounging for funds even after school is over.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color:darkorchid;"> My Hobbies</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Listening to music</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Music has a hand in all my daily activities. Everything I do that doesn't involve direct communication with another person is accompanied by music, even sleeping.<br> The music I listen to ranges from classic rock like The Police and Talking Heads, to Rappers like J.I.D and Busdriver, Jazz artists from Brubeck to Coltrane, and everything from Incognito, Mac Demarco, and Jamiroquai in between.<br> Music is a tool that I use to either calm myself or gain focus depending on what I need at the time, and luckily I have a playlist for any feeling I seek so I'm never without a tune in hand.<br>I also enjoy videos explaining the history and fundaments of the music I listen to. There was a series running on the Vox channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIge2mYdTtM&list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5fyqfIwGjH2fYC5fFLfdwW4" target="_blank"><em>Earworm</em></a> that really held my interest for a good amount of time.</li> 
                    </ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Hanging with my friends</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My friends are the rocks that keep me on level ground. We'll go out and hit the town(not in 2020 though) and we'll watch TV or movies or play video games together and those moments I can safely say are the best I've had in college so far.</li>
                    </ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Playing fighting games</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I enjoy learning new fighting systems and finding new characters whose mechanics resonate with me, and I enjoy finding the most optimal and doable sequences to tear my opponent a new one.</li>
                    </ul>
				</li>
            </ol>
